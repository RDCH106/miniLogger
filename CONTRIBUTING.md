===============
This document briefly lists the guidelines for contributing to miniLogger.

Reporting Bugs
----------------
When creating an issue in GitHub, try to include when feasible:
*  A brief description of the issue
*  Steps to reproduce
*  Data to reproduce the described steps


Contributing Code
--------------------------
One of the major goals of miniLogger is to be easy to modify and hack.

If you fix a bug or add a cool feature, please submit a pull request!


### Code Style

*  Use 2 spaces for indentation
*  Use comments whenever the code's meaning is not obvious
*  When in doubt, try to match the style in existing source files

### Submitting Pull Requests

*  Try to limit pull requests to a single narrow feature or bug fix.
*  Include a short changelog describing the changes in the pull request
*  Pull Requests must be generated in the `develop` branch. The `master` branch is reserved to the most stable features.
